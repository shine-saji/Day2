  <h2>Welcome to Malappuram!</h2>
  <br>



  <p>
    The hilly district of Malappuram falls among the northern districts in the state of Kerala. Closely bordered by the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats on its east, and flanked by the Arabian Sea on the West, Malappuram has an eventful history with the Zamorins of Kozhikode ruling the region for a significant period in the past. The district has also witnessed several local uprisings against the British rule, and was once a prominent center for Hindu-Vedic learning and Islamic philosophy. Historic monuments, natural attractions, ritual art forms, ethnic cuisine and age-old traditions make Malappuram a unique destination for travelers.

  <p>Nilambur, most popularly known as the land of teak plantations, is a famous town in Malappuram district. The place is noted for its vast expanse of forest along with its varied wildlife habitats, rivers and waterfalls. It is situated close to the Nilgiri range of the Western Ghats on the banks of the Chaliyar River
    <br><br>Considered to be the oldest in the world, the teak plantation here obtained its name after H.V. Conolly, the Malabar district collector during the British rule. He was instrumental in planting teak in the entire Nilambur area. Chathu Menon, a forest officer under Conolly, organised the hectic task of planting the saplings. Chathu Menon was laid to rest in the teak garden in Conolly's Plot.The teak plantation in Nilambur is situated about four kilometres from the town, on the Nilambur - Gudallur road. A well-equipped teak museum is another attraction of Nilambur. This museum is a sub-centre of the Kerala Forest Research Institute. Arranged in the two-storeyed building are exhibits, articles and details of historic, aesthetic and scientific value, which give information on all aspects of the teak to visitors
