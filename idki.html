        <p>Also known as Kalliyanathandu, Kalvari Mount is a stunning vantage point that offers an aerial view of the Idukki Reservoir and its surrounding peaks and forests. The viewpoint is situated near Thankamani Junction on Thodupuzha - Puliyanmala highway. It is one of the most scenic places that one must-visit during Idukki trip. During Lent, the area turns into a pilgrimage center as Christians go in a procession up the hillock.

          It is also an ideal place for mountain climbers and trekkers. The trekkers will be treated to a fascinating experience of low-hung clouds, cool breeze, occasional chirping birds, and hordes of sauntering elephants. However, the hillock has a very steep slope and is mostly scaled by professional trekkers. The trekkers and travelers can take a break at the nearby Tea Factory that offers the finest tea.
          
          <br><br>As the road is rugged and the rocks are mostly slippery, it is advised to climb to the top only on foot. But if you are a professional driver and you have an SUV, you can choose to drive up. There is enough space to park your vehicles on top. There are two cottages at the foothills of the mountain that are managed by the forest department, where you can stay for the night.
