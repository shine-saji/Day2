    <h5>Thangassery Light House</h5>
    <img src="./Images/HD/klm/thangassery-light-house.jpg" id="Image" alt="">
    <p>The cylindrical lighthouse tower is painted in catchy red and white oblique bands. You can bear witness to the glorious sun setting over the Arabian Sea, as well as the rising moon as you drive down on the Lighthouse road. The Thangassery beach Lighthouse was built in 1902 to guide fishermen and sailors along the reef-riddled coastal waters. Its beacon can be seen up to 20km out at sea. History has it that prior to construction of the lighthouse, the British East India Company had installed a tower with an oil lamp.
      <br><br>Visitors are allowed to climb to the top of the 140feet high Thangassery lighthouse tower during 10am to 5pm. The tiresome 200steps climb up the spiraling staircase to the top of the tower is more than made up for by the spectacular 360 degrees panoramic view of the Arabian Sea and splendor of the backwaters and Kollam city.

      This lighthouse is the tallest lighthouse on the coast of Kerala and the splendid views from the tower draw tourists like a magnet. The enchanting beauty and the calm silence of the secluded area around the lighthouse are also great for a little family picnic, or just to spend some quality time alone with only our thoughts to keep us company.
    </p>
      <h6><u>How to Get Here</u></h6>
  <p>The Thangassery Light House is easily accessible since it is located in a good area, just 7.9 kilometres away from the centre of the town of Kollam. One can quickly reach the place by hiring a cab or by using means of public transport; though the former is the more advisable option. The lighthouse is also located near the Kollam Beach, and one can even choose to walk to the lighthouse from the beach.</p>
