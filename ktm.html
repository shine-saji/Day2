  <h2>Welcome to Kottayam!</h2>
  <br>



  <p>
    Kottayam district is famous for its rich heritage and literary tradition. It is renowned for its spice and rubber trade. Cradled by the backwaters and the Western Ghats, it is epitomised by its stretches of vast greenery, paddy fields and huge rubber plantations. Over five of the State’s leading newspaper publications originate from Kottayam. About four-fifth of books published in the State come from here as well. From trekking hotbeds like Nadukani and Kottathavalam to the rare avian life on display at the Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, this district encompasses everything that God’s Own Country is famous for. Well connected to the entire State, it is full of interesting historical and cultural locations that tell the tale of how the district was forged into its current form.

  <h5>Malarikkal Village Tourism</h5>
  <img src="./Images/HD/ktm/malarickal_village.jpg" id="Image" alt="">
  <p>Nestled far away from the chaos of urban life, there exists a quaint hamlet in the heart of Kottayam district. All it offers those who stumble upon it are a soothing experience of village life amidst endless paddy fields. Its massive stretches of backwaters and intrinsic natural beauty are slowly attracting tourists who seek a rendezvous wholly detached from their routine. Malarickal or Malarikkal is a jewel that people in Kerala are only slowly awakening to themselves. 
    <br><br>It isn’t just the emerald of its backwaters that awaits you here, as Malarickal lures you in with breathtaking shades of pink as well. The water lilies (Nymphaea Stellata or ambal in local parlance) greet the terrain during the end of the monsoon rains, which usually occurs annually between September and October. A carpet of pleasant pink envelops the entire region in a breathtaking formation that is hard to explain with mere words. They spread out over 600 acres of land, and locals advise that the best time to witness this phenomenon is morning and evening.

    <img src="./Images/HD/ktm/ilaveezhapoonchira.jpg" id="Image" alt="">
    <p>Ilaveezha poonchira, a hill station near Melukavu Mattom, 60kms from Kottayam is gaining tourist importance.
      Located among three beautiful hillocks Mankunnu, Kudayathoormala and Thonippara, Poonchira is a place of picturesque charm. Legends say that the pool here was a bathing place for Panchali the legendary heroine of Mahabharata. The D.T.P.C. is developing this place into a trekking spot. A tourist bungalow with rooms and dormitory to accommodate 15 people has been constructed. 
      <br><br>The beautiful valleys of Poonchira are spread across thousands of acres. The verdant landscape punctuated by the gigantic hills, each rising to around 3200 ft. is an ideal place to unwind. During the monsoons when the valley fills up to form a scenic lake, this place unveils yet another beautiful slice of nature. Ilaveezha poonchira means valley where leaves don’t fall and is named so because the place has no trees. This is also one of the best places in Kerala to witness both the sun rise and sunset.
